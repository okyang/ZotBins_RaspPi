## First Time Github Set-up
If you are using Windows and you do not have git, install [git bash] (https://gitforwindows.org/)

Open Git Bash and set up the global username and global email that is linked with your github account. If you don't want to type in your password all the time, include the third line of code as well.

```sh
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
git config --global credential.helper wincred
```
